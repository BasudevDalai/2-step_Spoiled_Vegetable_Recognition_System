# 2-step_Spoiled_Vegetable_Recognition_System
This project was a part of the work done by me and my team for All India Research Championship organized at IIT Kanpur. This is a CNN based image recognition model made on keras and tensorflow. The dataset was quite small and the overall validation accuracy obtained was 89% on the validation set.
In this project, the first step was to identify the vegetable using image classification which would easily classify the visible surface rottening of the vegetable. The second step was to check the vegetable through the gases it releases after getting spoiled using different using arduino and different sensors
